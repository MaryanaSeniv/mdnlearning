        >Pembroke Welsh Corgi</a
      >
      is a strong, athletic, and lively little herder who is affectionate and
      companionable without being needy. They are one the world's most popular
      herding breeds. At 10 to 12 inches at the shoulder and 27 to 30 pounds, a
      well-built male Pembroke presents a big dog in a small package. Short but
      powerful legs, muscular thighs, and a deep chest equip him for a hard
      day's work. Built long and low, Pembrokes are surprisingly quick and
      agile. They can be red, sable, fawn, and black and tan, with or without
      white markings. The Pembroke is a bright, sensitive dog who enjoys play
      with his human family and responds well to training. As herders bred to
      move cattle, they are fearless and independent. They are vigilant
      watchdogs, with acute senses and a 'big dog' bark. Families who can meet
      their bold but kindly Pembroke's need for activity and togetherness will
      never have a more loyal, loving pet.
